            HI I AM MANEESHA DILSHAN !
        </h2>
        <h3>" I am currently pursuing a degree in software engineering from IJSE(Institute Of Java Software
            Engineer). Born on 23th July 2001, Wadduwa is my home town and holds a special place in my heart.

            I am a friendly person. I have a natural inclination towards competition because I believe it
            drives me to strive for excellence and reach my full potential.

            I appreciate the moments of solitude. Drawing pictures is one of my favourite pastimes, and I find
            happiness.

            , my other passion is spending time with my friends. Their companionship brings immense joy to my
            life.

            In my journey as a software engineering student, I am constantly honing my skills and exploring
            new technologies. My passion is to contribute to the ever-evolving technology industry and make a
            positive impact through innovative solutions.

            Thank you for taking the time to get to know me better. I am excited about the opportunities ahead
            and look forward to connecting with like-minded people who share my passion for the wonders of
            software engineering and literature.</h3>
